  \begin{abstract}
  Spreading with astonishing speed, the novel SARS-CoV2 has swept the
  globe, causing enormous stress to health systems and prompting social
  distance guidelines and mandates to arrest its progress. While there is
  encouraging evidence that early public health interventions have slowed
  the spread of the virus, this has come at a high cost as the global
  economy is brought to its knees. How and when to ease restrictions to
  movement hinges in part on the question whether SARS-CoV2 will display
  seasonality associated with variations in temperature and humidity. In
  this research, we address this question by means of a spatial analysis
  of the incidence of COVID-19 in the provinces in Spain. Use of a spatial
  Seemingly Unrelated Regressions (SUR) approach allows us to model the
  incidence of reported cases of the disease per 100,000 population, as a
  function of temperature and humidity, while controlling for GDP per
  capita, population density, percentage of older adults in the
  population, and presence of mass transit systems. An interesting aspect
  of the spatial SUR approach is that it models incidence as a contagion
  process. Our results indicate that incidence of the disease is lower at
  higher temperatures. The evidence with respect to humidity is more
  mixed, with coefficients for this variable that are significant in only
  some equations. Our control variables also yield interesting insights,
  as population density and percentage of older adults display negative
  associations with incidence of COVID-19, whereas the presence of mass
  transit systems in the province is associated with a greater incidence
  of the disease.

\section{Introduction}\label{introduction}}

From a small outbreak linked to a live animal market at the end of 2019
to a global pandemic in a matter of weeks, the SARS-CoV2 virus has
threatened to overrun health systems the world over. In efforts to
contain the spread, numerous governments in many nations and regions
have either recommended or mandated social distancing measures, and as
of this writing, millions of people in five continents shelter in place.
There are encouraging signs that these measures have arrested the spread
of the virus where they have been implemented, and have thus helped to
keep a bad situation from becoming even worse (e.g., 2020). However,
this has come at a high cost, and the consequences for all spheres of
the economy, social, and cultural life have been dire (e.g., Fernandes,
2020; Luo and Tsang, 2020). As a result, there is a sense of urgency to
anticipate the progression of the pandemic, in order to plan for
progressive lifting of restrictions to movement and social contact
(e.g., Kissler et al., 2020). Needless to say, this has become a
delicate, and politically charged, balancing act between public health
and the economy (Gong et al., 2020).

A salient question in the debate on how and when to ease social
distancing measures is whether the virus will display seasonal
variations. Earlier, diverse studies have shown the effect of
temperature and humidity on the incidence of influenza (e.g., Mäkainen
et al., 2009; Jaakkola et al., 2014; Kudo et al., 2019). Jaakkola et
al.~(2014), for example, found that a decrease of temperature and
absolute humidity precedes the onset of symptoms of influenza A and B
viruses by 3 days in places where the temperature is low. After the
2002-2004 outbreak of SARS, researchers also began to investigate the
relationship between these factors and SARS-CoV. In this way, Casanova
et al.~(2010) used two surrogates, namely the gastroenteritis (TGEV) and
mouse hepatitis viruses (MHV), to find that virus inactivation was more
rapid at temperatures of 20C than 4C, and at 40C than 20C; in terms of
humidity, these researchers reported that survival of the virus was
lower at moderate relative humidity levels. In a similar vein, but
working directly with SARS-CoV, Chan et al.~(2011) found that viability
of the virus was lost at temperatures higher than 38C and relative
humidity superior to 95\%.

While existing research on similar pathogens suggests that SARS-CoV is
more stable and potentially easier to transmit in conditions of low
temperature and low humidity, it is far from certain that this will also
be the case with the novel SARS-CoV2. If such is the case, there is the
possibility of easing restrictions to social contact as the weather
warms; however, weeks or possibly months of costly measures could become
undone if not, and the restrictions are lifted prematurely. Not
surprisingly, given the stakes involved, this issue has already
triggered a lively debate.

Some of what is thought about the possible seasonality of COVID-19 is
based on analogies to the patterns of other known respiratory viruses.
However, de Ángel Solá et al.~(2020) note that ``not all seasonal
respiratory viruses experience the same spatiotemporal patterns''
(section 4). This urges caution when extrapolating from known viruses,
and indeed, the evidence in this respect is inconclusive. At a global
scale, whereas de Ángel Solá et al.~(2020) see less risk in the Caribean
Basin, Coelho et al.~(Coelho et al., 2020) warn that at least during the
exponential phase, expansion of the virus is not driven by climate.
Similarly, whereas Araujo and Naimi (2020) argue that spread of
SARS-CoV2 will likely be constrained by climate, Harbert et al.~(2020)
remain unconvinced that spatial modelling can currently discriminate the
distribution of the disease on the basis of climate, at least in the
United States. To further complicate matters, much of the relevant work
has yet to be peer-reviewed and therefore is open to change (see for
example the challenge of Harbert et al. (2020) to Araujo and Naimi
(2020)). In the United States, the National Academy of Sciences,
Engineering, and Medicine was engaged by the Office of the Executive for
guidance on this matter (see National Academies of Sciences, Engineering
and Medicine, 2020). Their conclusion summarizes the situation well (see
p.~6): ``Some limited data support a potential waning of cases in warmer
and more humid seasons, yet none are without major
limitations\ldots Additional studies as the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic unfolds
could shed more light on the effects of climate on transmission.''

With the above considerations in mind, our objective with this paper is
to contribute to the knowledge basis regarding the spread of COVID-19
and the influence of environmental factors, particularly temperature and
humidity. Hence, here we report results from a spatial analysis of
incidence of COVID-19 in fifty provinces in Spain. Spain is one of the
countries hardest hit by the virus, and enacted lockdown measures on
March 16, 2020, in response to a rapidly growing outbreak of COVID-19.
We combine data on reported cases of the disease with metereological
information, to create a spatio-temporal dataset covering a period of 30
days. We then join this dataset with provincial-level economic and
demographic information to act as controls to our key environmental
variables. These data are analyzed using a spatial Seemingly Unrelated
Regressions (SUR) approach, which allows us to model incidence of
COVID-19 as a spatial contagion process.

The results provide evidence of the effect of temperature on the
incidence of COVID-19. The evidence concerning humidity is more mixed:
while the direction of the effect is negative, as anticipated, the
coefficients for this variable are only significant in some of equations
in the system. Our control variables also provide some intriguing
insights. The results of this analysis provide support to the hypothesis
of seasonality of the novel SARS-CoV2, and should be of interest to
public health officials and policy makers wrestling with the question of
the trajectory of the pandemic.

<<<<<<< HEAD
For a better interpretation of the results of our analysis is necessary
to know the chronology of the epidemic outbreak in Spain. This
subsection presents a brief time line of COVID-19.

The first reported case of COVID-19 in Spain was on January 31th, were a
German tourist in the Canary Islands was positively tested, but the
first not imported case was diagnostic on February 27th in Sevilla
province (Andalusia). The epidemic was growing slowly at the beginning
but in March 11th the World Health Organization (WHO) declared
officially the pandemic. This declaration was a break point and on March
13th the Spanish National Government declare the ``Emergency Status''.
At this date, Spain have been declared 4209 cases of COVID-19 (mostly of
cases, 1990, in Madrid). Only essential services (e.g.~food, health) and
some economic subsector of industry and construction could to maintain
activity. On March 17th Spain closes its lands borders and only allows
entry to nationals and residents. From March 30th to April 12th (April
10th-12th Easter) lockdown of the Spanish people was hardened and only
essential activities were allowed.
=======
The first reported case of COVID-19 in Spain was on January 31th, when a
German tourist in the Canary Islands tested positive for the virus.
However, it was still a few weeks before the first domestic case was
reported, on February 27th in Sevilla province (Andalusia). In a short
period of time, after this relatively slow start, the outbreak flared.
By March 11th the World Health Organization (WHO) declared COVID-19
officially a pandemic. This declaration marked a turning point for the
public in Spain too. As of March 13th, the number of cases of COVID-19
reported in Spain was 4,473, with a majority of cases (1,990)
concentrated in Madrid: these numbers were at the time the worst
outbreak in Europe, after Italy. In response to the situation, on March
13th the Spanish National Government declared a state of emergency. As
part of the state of emergency restrictions to most activities were
imposed, with the exception of essential services (e.g.~food, health)
and some economic subsectors of industry and construction. A few days
later, on March 17th, Spain closed its lands borders to allow entry only
to returnee nationals and permanent residents. The lockdown was further
hardened between March 30th and April 12th (including the Easter weekend
of April 10th-12th) and during this period only essential activities
were allowed. During this period, there was a dramatic reduction in
overall mobility, both within provinces

Explain the rationale for selecting the variables.

For example: The literature about COVID-19 suggested that population
density is the one of the most important proliferate cause of these
viscous, however this ill spread with different intensity at big cities
of the world. Controlling for socioeconomic characteristics the
objective of this paper is observe the effect of clime on COVID-19
proliferation.

Some questions are important to point out. Is not evident present a
diary association between the temprature (resp. humidity) with declarate
case. There is evidences (ref) that a time lag is necessary between the
day that the individuo inffect and the case is diagnosticate

\subsection{Sources of Data}\label{sources-of-data}}

Our dataset includes information about the daily number of cases of
COVID-19 reported in Spain at the provincial level (NUTIII in Eurostat
terminology) for the period between March 13th and April 11th,
<<<<<<< HEAD
inclusive. This gives a temporal coverage of 30 days and spatial
coverage of 50 units. For our purposes, we consider positive cases
reported, but excluding symptomatic cases diagnosed by a doctor without
a Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) test. The Spanish National Government
publishes periodic updates at the regional level (NUTII) and the
information is also released at the provincial level as part of a
collaborative project {[}\textbf{by whom?}{]}. This information is
compiled from several sources, mainly the official web pages of the
Spanish regional goverments. In addition, we consider two sets of
explanatory variables. The first one, and the focus of this research, is
set of two environmental variables, namely temperature and humidity,
which are collected from official sources (i.g., AEMET, the state
meteorology agency, and MAPA, the ministry of agriculture, fisheries,
and food). The second set provides some relevant controls for
multivariate analysis, and refers to economic and demographic attributes
of the province (also collected from official sources, i.e., INE, the
national statistics institute). Table \ref{tab:descriptive-statistics}
shows the descriptive statistics and the provenance of the data.

The spatial and temporal coverage of the data is as follows. Our dataset
begins on March 13, which is the first date when every province had
reported at least one case of COVID-19, and continues until April 11,
for a period of 30 days. The unit of analysis is the province. Provinces
are the equivalent of states, and are embedded in Autonomous
Communities. As an example, Cataluña is an Autonomous Community and
consists of four provinces, namely Barcelona, Gerona, Lerida, and
Tarragona. The size of the provinces is relatively large, as seen in
Table \ref{tab:descriptive-statistics}. The smallest province is
\(1,978.12km^2\) (this is smaller than Rhode Island in the US) and the
largest province is \(21,767.93km^2\) (slightly smaller than New Jersey
in the US). While this is a relatively large degree of spatial
aggregation, reporting on COVID-19 is inconsistent at smaller
geographies, or cases are not reported at that level at all. The
analysis must therefore be considered ecological.

An important aspect of working with environmental data such as
temperature and humidity is the incubation period of the disease. Lauer
et al.~(2020) report for the case of COVID-19 a median incubation period
of 5.7 days (with a confidence interval between 4.9 to 7.8 days). The
vast majority of cases (95\%) develop symptoms between 2.6 days (CI, 2.1
to 3.7 days) and 12.5 days (CI, 8.2 to 17.7 days). For this reason, we
judge it best to use lagged values of the environmental variables. We
test different time lags as follows. We consider a lagged 8-day average,
from date-minus-12 to date-minus-5 days (hereafter \emph{lag8}).
Secondly, we consider a lagged 11-day average, from date-minus-12 to
date-minus-2 days (hereafter \emph{lag11}). Finally, to account for the
likely duration of incubation, we consider a lagged 11-day
\emph{weighted} average, from date-minus-12 to date-minus-2 days
(hereafter \emph{lag11w}). The weights for this variable are calculated
using the parameters of the log-normal distribution reported by Lauer et
al.~(2020), i.e., a log-mean of 1.621 and a log-standard deviation of
0.418. With these weights, the environmental variables at date-minus-2
and date-minus-12 days are weighted as 0.041 and 0.009 respectively,
whereas the environmental variables at date-minus-5 days are weighted as
0.194.

The Seemingly Unrelated Regression equations model (SUR hereafter) is a
multivariate econometric model used in different fields when the
structure of the data consisits of cross-sections for different time
periods. The basis of this approach is well-known since the initial
works of Zellner (1962), and has become a popular methodology included
in several econometrics textbook (e.g., Greene, 2003). To our knowledge,
Anselin (1988) was the first author to discuss SUR from a spatial
perspective. In his landmark text, Anselin discussed a model made of
``an equation for each time period, which is estimated for a cross
section of spatial units'' (p.~141). From this milestone, a large body
of research has developed to extend the classical SUR into a spatial
framework (e.g., Rey and Montouri, 1999; Lauridsen et al., 2010; Le
Gallo and Dall'Erba, 2006; López et al., 2017).

The classical SUR model without spatial effects (hereafter, SUR-SIM) is
>>>>>>> f448d32e3b23eaeeae8d724e650eecd0819fef40
a stack of equations as follows:

\begin{equation}
\label{eq:sur-sim}
\begin{bmatrix}
y_1 \\ y_2 \\ \vdots \\ y_T
\end{bmatrix}
=
\begin{bmatrix}
X_1 & 0 & \cdots & 0 \\ 0 & X_2 & \cdots & 0 \\ \vdots & \vdots & \ddots & \vdots \\ 0 & 0 & \cdots & X_T
\end{bmatrix}
\
\begin{bmatrix}
\beta_1 \\ \beta_1 \\ \vdots \\ \beta_T
\end{bmatrix}
+
\begin{bmatrix}
\epsilon_1 \\ \epsilon_2 \\ \vdots \\ \epsilon_T
\end{bmatrix}
\end{equation}

\noindent where \(y_{t}=(y_{1t},...,y_{Nt})\) is an \(N \times 1\)
vector, and in our case \(y_{st}\) is the incidence ratio in province
\(s\text{ }s=1,...,N\)) on day \(t\text{ }(t=1,...,T)\);
\(X_t=(X^1,...,X^{k_t})\) is an \(N \times k_t\) matrix of the \(k_t\)
independent variables, \(X_i=(X^i_{st})\);
\(\beta_t=(\beta_{1t},...,\beta_{Nt})\) is a vector of coefficients and
\(\epsilon_t=(\epsilon_{1t},...,\epsilon_{Nt})\) is the usual vector of
random residuals.

A key feature of the SUR framework is the dependence structure among the
vectors of random residuals, which takes the following form:

\begin{equation}
\label{eq:sur-err}
E[\epsilon_t \epsilon'_{t'}]=\sigma_{tt'}
\end{equation}

Note that this specification is very flexible, since it allows the
coefficients \(\beta_{it}\) to vary in order to modulate the effect of
\(X^i_{.t}\) on \(y_t\). A less flexible if more parsimonious model can
be obtained by imposing restrictions to some \(\beta\) coefficients to
fix them across equations. This is equivalent to specifying an effect
that is constant in time. In this case, we can reformulate the
coefficients expression of
\(\beta_t = (\beta_{1}, \cdots, \beta_{r-1}, \beta_{r}, \beta_{r+1}, \cdots, \beta_{Nt})\)
to restrict the first \(r\) coefficients to be constant.

Equation \ref{eq:sur-sim}) can be rewriten in compact form as follows:

\begin{equation}
y = X \beta + \epsilon
\end{equation}

\noindent where\ldots.

As is the case with cross-sectional data, it is possible to test the
residuals of Model \ref{eq:sur-sim} for spatial autocorrelation, and
several tests have been developed to test the null hypothesis of spatial
independence (see López et al., 2014). When the null hypothesis is
rejected, several alternative specifications have been proposed to
include spatial effects (Anselin, 1988, see also 2016). In this paper we
consider a spatial SUR model that incorporates a spatial lag of the
dependent variable as an explanatory factor. A sp

\bf{A}y = X \beta + \epsilon \\
\epsilon =N(0,\Omega)
\end{equation}

\noindent where \(A =I_{TN}-\bf{\rho} \otimes W\) with
\(\bf{\rho} = diag(\rho_1, \cdots, \rho_T)\).

This specification assumes that incidence in a province (\(y_st\)) at
time \(t\) is partially determined by the weighted average (\(Wy_{st}\))
of incidence in neighbouring provinces. Coefficients for the spatially
lagged variable are estimated for each time period \(\rho_t\) and
identifies the intensity and the sign of the impacts of neighbourhood.
It is possible test the null hypotheis of identtical levels of spatial
dependence (\(\rho_i=\rho_j, \forall i,j\)). The correspond Wald test is
available in the R package \texttt{spsur}.

The SUR-SLM model can be estimated using maximum likelihood (López et
al. (2014)) or instrumental variables (Mínguez et al. (2019)).

Another alternative methodologies could be use. By example, a dynamic
spatial panel methodology with fixed spatial an temporal effects
(e.g.~Elhorst 2014, Cap. 4), but those models are more dont take account
correlation between errors. Therefore, a spatial SUR approach is more
reasonable for our purpose.

\subsection{Exploratory Data Analysis}\label{exploratory-data-analysis}}

We begin with the exploratory analysis of the data.

Figure \ref{fig:weekly-average-incidence-map} shows the geographical
variation in the incidence of the disease, as well as its temporal
progression in weekly averages. It can be seen that the highest
incidence at this early date was in the provice of Álava, in the North
of Spain. While not the most populous province, with a population of
only 331,549, Álava has the highest GDP per capita of all provinces.
Vitoria, its main city, is the capital of the Basque country and has
been the focus of efforts to develop a ``Global Basque City'' (Meijers
et al., 2008), along with San Sebastian and Bilbao. The other early
focus of the pandemic in Spain was Madrid, which is the most populous
province in the country and has the second highest GDP per capita after
Álava. The early outbreaks in these two provinces can be traced
throughout the progression of the pandemic over time, although by the
end of the period under consideration, other provinces had matched and
even surpased their incidence rates, including Segovia and Soria to the
north of Madrid, and Ciudad Real and Albacete to the south.

\caption{\label{fig:weekly-average-incidence-map}Mean weekly incidence
of COVID-19 by province, in reported cases by 100,000 people (map omits
Islas Canarias)}
\end{figure}

To visualize the distribution of temperature and humidity we aggregate
the provinces by Autonomous Community. In Figure
\ref{fig:descriptives-temperature} the communities have been sorted by
latitude, so that Principado de Asturias is the northernmost community,
and Canarias the southernmost. There is a relatively wide range of
values both within and between provinces over the 30 day period
examined. The top panel of the figure shows the distribution of mean
temperature. The lowest mean temperature for a community on any given
day is 2.8C, and the highest is 22.4C for a range of approximately 20
degrees. Likewise, there is a great deal of variability in humidity, as
seen in the bottom panel of the figure, where the lowest mean humidity
for any community is 48.3 and the highest is 99.6. The actual values for
the provinces display somewhat more variability even.

northermost, and to the right the southernmost}

\end{figure}

Figure \ref{fig:daily-correlations} shows the distribution of daily
correlations of the independent variables with incidence of COVID-19,
after log-transforming all variables. It can be seen there that the
correlation of GDPpc and temperature (in its three definitions) have the
strongest positive and negative correlations with incidence,
respectively. Percentage of older adults displays somewhat weaker
negative correlations with incidence, as does density. It can be seen
that the humidity variable, in its three forms, tends to be possitively
correlated with incidence of COVID-19.
